# Advanced-Cones
Blender addon for more complex cone-like shapes (tangent and secant ogives, prolate spheroids, parabolic cones, power series and Haack series). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nose_cone_design for mathematical explanation

# Changelog
## v1.1

* correct name of prolate hemispheroid

* add "smooth tip" option to prolate hemispheroid, correct bug where final vertex was not added

* fix bug in secant ogive with minimum ogive radius relative to base radius and apex length

* corrected default parameters for secant ogive to actually fit the secant ogive definition

* objects now spawn at 3d cursor location, not scene center

# Planned features

* Set rotation at spawn

* New shapes: biconics, spherically-blunted cone
